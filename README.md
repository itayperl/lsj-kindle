lsj-kindle
==========

An Ancient Greek-English dictionary for the Kindle. The dictionary is generated from
texts available at the [Perseus library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu).

Note that this is the abridged "Middle Liddell" and not the full LSJ. It should
be sufficient for most commonly read literature.

Status:

1. Dictionary is very usable.
2. The dictionary XML was modified a bit from the Perseus source. Mostly
   inconsistent beta code that interfered with my parser.
3. Quite a few inflections are dropped due to weird/uncommon beta code. These
   are printed during processing ("bad beta...").  Probably a lot of these can
   be fixed. 
   All of the beta code in the dictionary itself is converted correctly
